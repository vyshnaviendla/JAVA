// Liam was a curious boy who loved playing with secret codes. 

// One day, while flipping through an old book in his grandfather’s library, he found a strange note that read:
// "To reveal the true form of a letter, flip its hidden switch!"

// Liam scratched his head. What could it mean?
// He decided to experiment. He took a small chalkboard and wrote down a few letters:
// H e L l O W o R l D
// He then noticed something interesting—each letter had a twin in a different case. 
// Some were uppercase, some were lowercase. "What if I could magically switch them?" he wondered.

// As he played with the letters, he discovered a fascinating trick. 
// If he used a simple rule—flipping just the right part of a letter’s identity—he could swap between uppercase and lowercase instantly.

// Excited by his discovery, Liam ran to his grandfather, who smiled and said, 
// "Ah, you’ve uncovered the XOR trick! With a simple flip, letters can change their form."

// Your Task:
// Liam wants to automate his discovery. 
// Can you help him write a program that takes a word and swaps the case of each letter using his newly found trick?

// Input Format:
// A single string containing uppercase and lowercase letters.

// Output Format:
// A string where each letter has been swapped to the opposite case.

// Example 1:
// Input =HeLLo WoRLd
// Output= hEllO wOrlD
