// In a popular convention center, multiple event sessions are scheduled, and attendees have registered for time slots to enter and 
// collect exclusive event goodies. Each session slot has a specific entry fee, which varies based on demand and timing,
// and is clearly marked on the registration pass.

// A total of N time slots have been booked for different attendees. Some attendees have booked multiple slotsâ€”sometimes consecutively, 
// sometimes scattered. After all registrations are complete, the event organizers introduce the following policies:

// -An attendee is permitted to attend only one session, and not two consecutive sessions.
// -Each attendee is identified by a unique lowercase letter.
// -The registration fees for unused or invalid slots will be refunded to the attendees.

// You are given:

//  A string representing the sequence of registered slots with attendee IDs.
//  A list of fees associated with each slot, aligned with the attendee sequence.

// Your task is to help the organizers compute the minimum total refund amount that needs to be issued to attendees due to unused 
// consecutive bookings.
